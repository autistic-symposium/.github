### gm anon, if you are new here, this is the tl; dr:

<br>

- **bt3gl** (read "bytegirl") is a **genius polymath hacker, engineer, and scientist** who has been building and collecting achievements in these fields since childhood.
- on top of this, she has become sort of a **subversive cypherpunk celebrity**. a **growing anonymous cult surrounds her** for many reasons, from many directions (by the way, she coined the term "neo-cypherpunk" back in 2022 - later adopted by the ethereum community).
- **she is the queen of psyops** (in the good way, i.e., fighting the "bad guys"). folks follow the commits in this organization, and some groups even have **automated updates for her projects**. you can follow her ideas and personal thoughts at the **["club"](https://loyal.love/)**. 
- it's **too hard to explain the full story** here - trust us, she is a legend and **"everybody" knows some of her tales**.
- think of it like this: **"the first rule of [the cult of bt3gl](https://jewandwitch.com/pages/the-cult-of-bt3gl) is you don't talk about the cult of bt3gl"** (but you find clever ways to signal that you are in the cult without outright saying it =p)
- she holds **many online identities** and works on **multiple campaigns and projects simultaneously**. yes, **she is satoshi nakamoto**. but, hey, so are you, right? ;)
- the **[@autistic-symposium-helper](https://github.com/autistic-symposium-helper)** account is owned by collaborators of the cause (bt3gl included), and we all operate under various identities. **you are welcome to join in and help in your own way**.
- fair warning: **spicy messages and commits are often short-lived**, meaning we intentionally clean "information" after a few days. while *information wants to be free*, the space moves, and this communication style feels the *cleanest* to us.
- we are here to **improve the world and [d/acc](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/08/21/plurality.html) the building of a golden era for humans on earth** and the **[future of finance](https://www.etherealize.io/)** - and we do this by provoking folks to **develop critical thinking, to focus on their craft, and to understand the joy of true freedom**.
- **kindness is the ultimate wisdom**, and **the courage to stand for what is right is utterly beautiful**.
- finally, **we are just starting.**
